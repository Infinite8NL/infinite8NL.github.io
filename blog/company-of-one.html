        <h1>A company of One</h1>
        <p>Because of "new" tax regulations (they're not technically new, they're only newly enforced) here in the Netherlands there is quite some uncertainty on what this will mean for self-employed people. Now I don't think enforcing this particular law is a bad thing (mostly), I'm not planning to bore you with my opinion on this any further.</p>

        <h2>Going forward</h2>
        <p>The new regulations did get me thinking about what it is that I want to do in the next couple of years "business-wise". I specialise in big, complex software migrations, moving from old legacy systems to new setups that tend to evolve underway while we learn. These things almost by definition take a lot of time. This means that I tend to work for a single client for a longer period of time, thus the governmont enforcing the new laws could potentially affect me. On the other hand I bring in a lot of expertise and previous headaches on the topic at hand and I'm already employed by a company (my own) so it's probably fine. The more interesting question at hand is how I would see my company grow in the coming years.</p>
        <p>The answer I kept coming back to again and again was this: I don't. At least not in the conventional way of getting more people on board. In recent times I've talked to potential business partners and thought about hiring people but after taking a short vacation doing a lot of outdoor activities (okay and playing some Civ, I'm only human) I've come to the conclusion that it's just not what I want. I'd like to keep focus on providing the most value to my clients, instead of managing other people in between. I don't think worrying about hiring and performance reviews is what I'd like to be doing  if I can also get better at helping clients with building cool solutions for their problems. Don't get me wrong: It's not that I'm some sort of lone wolf. I love working with smart people. I just don't need them to work for me.</p>
        <h2>The idea behind a company of one</h2>

        <p>This insight made me go back to a book that I've read before on this: <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37570605-company-of-one'>Company of One</a> by Paul Jarvis. A book that I enjoyed a lot the first time I read it, but it really resonated with me this time. It talks about not working towards quick growth, but consistently putting in work towards growing your company in a sustainable way over years. It's about working towards having enough instead of working towards getting as much as possible.</p>
        <p>Another thing that resonates with me is making sure your company is really a different entity from you personally. It’s something that I find quite hard actually. Technically my company is its own entity, but I find it hard to decouple who I am from what I do. I try my best in the work that I do, no matter if it’s coding, consulting, or my writing. This brings along some sense of pride. That makes it quite hard to take if I screw something up. In a way, I think that shows that you care and I hope I never fully lose it, but it’s one of those things I’m working on moving forward. That’s also the reason I decided to move my writing to my company’s blog. Although these pieces can still be quite personal, I feel like I should create some distance between me and the writing moving forward.</p>
        <p>Hopefully that will help me get back into the habit again.</p>
